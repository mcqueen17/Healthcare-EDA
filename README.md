# About This Project
This project demonstrates a full exploratory analysis workflow using a synthetic healthcare dataset designed to mirror real-world clinical, demographic, and utilization patterns. It highlights the core analytical skills used across healthcare quality, population health, and value-based care environments—cleaning patient-level data, exploring risk factors, visualizing trends, and identifying drivers of 30-day readmissions.

The goal of this project is to showcase the technical and analytical capabilities required for healthcare analytics roles, including EDA, data quality checks, insight generation, and basic clinical interpretation. It reflects how an analyst supports quality improvement, SDoH initiatives, care management programs, and operational decision-making through data.

# Project Highlights
## 1. End-to-End Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Full Python-based EDA workflow using pandas and matplotlib

Univariate and bivariate analysis of demographics, clinical factors, and utilization metrics

Identification of patterns in age, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, comorbidities, and hospital visits

Readmission-focused insights aligned with real-world population health analytics

## 2. Healthcare-Specific Insight Generation

Analysis centered around 30-day hospital readmissions, a key quality metric

Exploration of relationships between clinical risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, smoking status) and outcomes

Population-level trends consistent with CMS, payor, and quality improvement use cases

Demonstrates how analysts support care management, SDoH programs, and QI initiatives

## 3. Clean, Structured, SQL-Ready Dataset

Synthetic dataset designed to mimic real patient-level clinical and utilization data

Intentionally simple data schema to enable:

SQL practice

BI dashboards

Modeling demos

Data quality walkthroughs

Includes a full data dictionary (column names, types, and definitions)

## 4. Key Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases competencies essential for healthcare analytics roles, including:

Data cleaning and validation

Exploratory data analysis

Visualization and interpretation
