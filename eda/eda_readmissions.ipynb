## Key Findings & Clinical Interpretation

- 30-day readmission rates were consistently higher than 7-day rates, aligning with CMS quality measurement standards.
- Asthma showed the highest 30-day readmission rate among primary medical conditions, which is clinically plausible due to chronic disease management challenges.
- Monthly readmission trends revealed variability across discharge months, suggesting potential seasonal or care-transition factors.

### Quality Implications
- Targeted interventions for high-risk conditions (e.g., asthma) may reduce preventable readmissions.
- Monitoring both 7-day and 30-day windows provides early warning signals for care coordination gaps.
